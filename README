KURKI-IMPORT HOWTO

1) Organize your Google Doc as follows. Creating extra sheets is good. Nothing extra (except #comments). The first 0 (zero) in student number is optional.

# assignment points (sheet 1)
012345678	1	0	3	4
012345679	0	2	3	0
...

# exam points (sheet 2)
012345678	4	8	12
012345679	1	0	1
...

2) Export (download as) "text", you should now have:

my-course-assignments.tsv
my-course-exams.tsv

3) Set course settings in KURKI! Otherwise things will silently fail. You'll need a correct number of assignments, exams and whatnot, with the correct point scale.

4) Find correct course and copy the course id:

kurki-import -n

5) Import points:

kurki-import -c 512345.2010.S.K.1 -p 0 my-course-assignments.tsv
kurki-import -c 512345.2010.S.K.1 -p 2 my-course-exams.tsv

7) Check KURKI if everything is ok

Notice that having point 0 (zero) and "" (empty) is different for KURKI (and kurki-import), as 0 triggers "attended the course" status, and cause a FAIL for student! Beware!

8) Publish course results! Good luck.
